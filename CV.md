## SKILLS
I have a wide range of personal skills, including resilience, determination, a flexible can-do attitude and enjoy new challenges and opportunities. Experience in communication, public speaking, employability and teamwork. I have great time-keeping skills and have proved myself to be a thoroughly reliable student both at work and university. Through my course I have gained three years experience in C++,  DX11, DX12, PS4 Development and Vulkan, and the maths used to create and compute graphical effects. As well as working with Unreal and Unity. Finally, learning to implement AI in games using modern methods. While developing all these projects, either as a team or by myself, I’ve made full use of source control tools like Git and GitHub desktop.  

## EDUCATION
#### Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield - Undergraduate
##### October 2019 - PRESENT
I am nearing the end of my three year course and greatly enjoyed gaining an in-depth understanding into not only how games function but computers as a whole. While here I worked on several interesting projects, the two I am most proud of would be ‘Project Simulation’ and a Vulkan port of Zool: Redimentioned made in collaboration with Sumo Digital Academy. Both were made in collaboration with other students. Project Simulation was a first person melee game made in Unreal and was graded 98 / 100, doing so well the team was asked to show it off at the end of year fair. The Vulkan port for Zool was a great chance to gain experience and work with a real company in a semi-professional scenario on an existing code base.
#### Brookfield Community School, Chesterfield - A-level
##### September 2017 - July 2019
While studying here I performed to the best of my ability, ensuring I was always on time and my homework was completed to the same calibre as my favourable classwork. Here I received distinctions from my teachers for always involving myself in lessons and engaging with the learning material. Here I achieved three A-levels grade C.

## EXPERIENCE
#### Cromford Mills Cafés 
##### 2021 - PRESENT
These are a trio of cafés, privately owned by the Arkwright Society, a stone's throw from one another. Selling cooked food ranging from simple sandwiches and cakes to carbonara, as well as offering a wide selection of hot and cold drinks. While working here in catering I greatly enjoyed learning a lot of the fundamentals of employment as well as dramatically improving on a breadth of highly transferable skills such as working quickly as a member of a team while under pressure, problem solving, critical thinking skills and forward planning. All developed through having to find solutions to problems in the kitchen and in the dining area with customers daily. Planning how much stock would be required for that day and helping prepare the necessary food. I was also able to boost my confidence and independence when taking the required responsibility of working alone in one of the smaller takeaway cafés. Especially during COVID when we were constantly having to implement new strategies in order to keep our colleagues and customers safe.
#### Vintage Wheels Catering Co.
##### 2013 - 2016  
This was a family run business, based on Hasland’s Eastwood Park, operating through a council licence. We provided high quality cakes, beverages and other refreshments to clients using the park, including barista coffees from a hand pump coffee machine.  As a young person at the time, my involvement with the business was limited to a few hours after school, when I helped clean and clear, restock and take small orders. However, I was able to observe the process of running the business from our home on a full-time basis.

## PERSONAL
I'm cheerful, confident and well-motivated. I enjoy working with friends and by myself on projects and hobbies in my free time, including walking and cycling in the peak district. I also greatly enjoy getting out and about, whether it be for pleasure or for work. Furthermore I became a student rep at my university, making sure to help my fellow classmates and get their feedback on the course and the amenities the university provides. The experience gained from this would be a tremendous use to any job I undertake in future. While being a student I have also lived by myself and as a result gained independence and responsibility.
