## PERSONAL
I'm cheerful, confident and well-motivated. I have always enjoyed learning how things are made and why things are the way they are. This is one of the main reasons I got into Computer Science, as well as my love for games which I gained from a young age. These traits combined and I soon found myself listening to developer commentaries and making basic games in Scratch. Nowadays I work in IDEs like Unreal Engine 4 and 5 and am working on a 3D Vulkan game engine. Aside from this I love getting out in the Peak District, walking and biking around its many beauties.

## SKILLS
#### Technical
- **C++ and C#:** Through my course I have gained three years experience in C++ and a year of Unity C#. To develop apps and games.
- **Graphics APIs:**  While studying I’ve made direct use of DX11, DX12, PS4 and Vulkan to create light-weight renderers and games.
- **Console Development:** PS4 Development, using Sony provided materials to learn how to make a light-weight 3D game engine, including blinn-phong lighting and model loading.
- **Maths for Modelling and Rendering:** The basics of vector maths, matrices as well as polygon maths like barycentric coordinates, Euler’s formula and manifold meshes. Use of MATLAB for scripting to solve and plot nonlinear equations and matrix mathematics.
- **IDE Game Engines:** I’ve made basic games using Unity and Unreal, including a plugin for the latter. 
- **Game AI:** Implementing AI using behaviour trees and the environment query system in Unreal and a rabbit AI in my PS4 engine, that made use of Monte Carlo to search an unknown space.
- **Source Control:** While developing all these projects, either as a team or by myself, I’ve made full use of source control tools like Git and GitHub desktop. 
- **Web Development:** I’ve done some light web development using Visual Studio Code in the past with HTML5, CSS and a small amount of JavaScript, though I mostly used C# for page interactivity.

#### Personal
I have a wide range of personal skills, including resilience, determination, a flexible can-do attitude and enjoy new challenges and opportunities. Experience in communication, public speaking, employability and teamwork. I have great time-keeping skills and have proved myself to be a thoroughly reliable student both at work and university.

## EDUCATION
##### University of Leeds, Leeds - Postgraduate
###### *September 2022 - November 2022*
Here I studied MSc High Performance Graphics, learning some of the more advanced topics I wanted to cover after finishing my bachelors at Sheffield Hallam. These topics include interesting raytracing in OpenGL, kinematics and animation using BVH files along with geometric processing encompassing mesh data structures and subdivisions.
##### Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield - Undergraduate
###### *October 2019 - June 2022*
**1st Class Honours Degree**

Here I did the highly enjoyable Comp Sci for Games course. I worked on several interesting projects, ‘Project Simulation’ and a Vulkan port of Zool: Redimentioned made in collaboration with Sumo Digital Academy being good examples.
Project Simulation was a first person melee game made in Unreal. I worked on some of the movement features along with the enemies and their AI for the rest of the six week project. While on Zool I spent most of my time handling buffers and making sure shaders and descriptors were set up correctly for images, among other things.
Both nominated at their respective end of year fairs. Zool came second place for Games Technology, at the Games Republic event in York. It was also nominated for the TIGA “Excellence in University/College – Industry Collaboration” award. 
##### Brookfield Community School, Chesterfield - A-level
###### September 2017 - July 2019
**Three Grade Cs**

Here I learned the broad strokes of Computer Science. Such as: the basics of programming using Python, networking, SQL, databases, computer hardware, binary maths, logic gates and much more.

## EMPLOYMENT & VOLUNTEERING
##### Cromford Mills Cafés 
###### *September 2021 - September 2022*
While working here in catering I greatly enjoyed learning a lot of the fundamentals of employment as well as dramatically improving on a breadth of highly transferable skills such as working as a member of a team while under pressure, problem solving, critical thinking skills and forward planning. From problem solving in the kitchen and in the dining area with customers daily, planning how much stock would be required for that day and helping prepare the necessary food. I was also able to boost my confidence and independence when taking the required responsibility of working alone in one of the smaller takeaway cafés. Especially during COVID when we were constantly having to implement new strategies in order to keep our colleagues and customers safe.
##### Sheffield Hallam University
###### *October 2019 - March 2020*
I became a student rep at my university, making sure to help my fellow classmates and get their feedback on the course and the amenities the university provides. Attending meetings to then relay this information on to the faculty. Developing confidence and communication skills.
