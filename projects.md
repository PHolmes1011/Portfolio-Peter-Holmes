## Zool: Redimentioned Port

![Zool's main menu](/Images/Original/MainMenu.png)

This was a port of the already released game Zool: Redimentioned to Vulkan from DirectX 11. This was sanctioned and overseen by Jacob Habgood from Sumo Digital Academy, and was a great opportunity to get professional experience workong on a challenging and engaging project, and I couldn't be more thankful for all the people at Sumo and Sheffield Hallam for making it happen.

The team was composed of six programmers, including myself, none of whom had done Vulkan before. We had to learn and research as we went to achieve a succeful prototpye port. If Sumo Digital want to take this further and invest more in the project, me and the rest of the team would gladly carry it on.

## Lightweight PlayStation 4 Engine

This was another amazing opportunity I got thanks to enrolling at Sheffield Hallam, not every university is accredited for PlayStation 4 development. In this project I got to delve into console development making a light weight 3D game engine that could load models and textures, transform them, and had basic ambient and directional lighting. Functionality had to be researched from official Sony documention as of course none of this information was available on Stack Overflow.

I really enjoyed my time working on the PlayStation as it was fun, challenging and gave me a real sense that I was doing something special. As in, it required more than just downloading some libraries and working on it in my bedroom. It made me feel professional and optimisitc for the future.

## Project Simulation

### About The Game

This was the completed game made with a team of designers and artists as well as another programmer. We all had to work together, in a professional scenario, to develop a game of our choosing. All the while making sure we held scrum meetings, plotted and planned our progress as well as proper version control. This was an absolute pleasure to work on, getting a taste of the scene I’d like to be a part of.

The game we all agreed we wanted to make was a first person movement based melee game, in the Unreal Engine. The art style would be simple 3D meshes with bold contrasting colours, like something akin to the game ‘Super Hot’ but with fast and fluid gameplay. The player has to run, jump and cut his way through the hordes of robotic foes which are there to destroy the very simulation they are a part of.

As previously mentioned, I was one of the two programmers on this project. We worked together, giving each-other tasks at meetings and collaborating to solve problems and make the game all we’d hoped it could be. For instance, while he did much of the movement mechanics I did much of the work for the game’s enemies. Getting the models, playing the animations, coding the AI and making them hunt and attack the player.

We all worked great together as a team and the end result of our combined efforts was an amazing game worthy of a 98 / 100, being the highest marked game of the year and even all previous submissions.

## Planetary Plugin

This is a plugin made for my final year project at Sheffield Hallam. I chose to simulate NBody problems for the purpose of use by game developers. This was the reason I chose to make it within Unreal Engine 4.

As it's for game developers, it needs to be accessable for game developers. The link to it is below:

I also made a video for it and have included that below too

## DirectX 12 Explanatory Videos

This was a project undertaken at the beginning of my third year, for the purpose of gaining understanding on these low level subjects. This knowledge was useful in later projects, especially the Play Station 4 engine.
