## About Me
My name’s Peter Holmes, I'm in my early 20s and am greatly enthusiastic about computer science and software development. I studied at Sheffield Hallam on the computer science for games course, with the end goal of getting a job in the games industry and of course because it sounded fun. I was soon shown I had made the right decision, I loved learning about computer and console architecture, along with programming and software development techniques. Gaining experience in DirectX 11 & 12, PlayStation 4 development, Unity and Unreal. Not to mention being surrounded with cool, interesting and likeminded people. Some of whom I'd develop projects with as a part of the course and extracurricular. It really showed that this was the future for me and something I could be passionate about.

I then went on to study a masters at the University of Leeds in high performancee computer graphics, however I found it didn't capture the same enjoyment as I'd experienced during my time at Sheffield, so despite learning some interesting things I sought out other opportunities.

### What I’m Doing
This leads on to what I'm doing now. I'm looking for jobs in the games industry and in software engineering as a whole. In the meantime, I'm keeping my skills sharp developing a game in Unreal Engine 5 and working on my 3D Vulkan renderer which I one day plan to use for a simple game.

## Stuff I've Done

### During the first year I:

- Began learning C++, using SFML to make a side-scrolling survival game.

- Learned useful mathematics to lay the foundations for understanding computer graphics.

- How the different components of the computer work, communicate and process data.

- Took a look at the professional issues surrounding a job in software engineering.

- Began developing a group project as a multi-disciplinary team in a workplace scenario.

### During the second year I:

- Using the knowledge from the first year we took a look at more complex coding practices and began using DirectX 11 as opposed to SFML to make 2D and 3D scenes.

- Took the maths knowledge to the next level to learn how computers handle; lighting, shading, handle polygonal meshes and even physics.

- How to optimise given code with processes like BUD as well as threading and SIMD.

- Developed another project, A game named "Project Simulation", with the same team. Reaching an almost perfect mark of 98 / 100.

### During the third year I:

- I made three videos on a chosen topic in DX12, for the purpose of demonstrating a graphics technique.

- I made a light weight game engine for the PlayStation 4.

- I worked as part of a team to develop a Vulkan port of Zool: Redimentioned in cooperation with Sumo Digital Academy.

- I expanded on my light weight PlayStation 4 engine to add AI agents to a scene.

- For my final year project I developed an Unreal plugin to simulate NBody systems for game developers to use.

## My Grades

This graph shows the number of all the different grades I received throughout my time at Sheffield Hallam university.

![A pie chart showing my grades](/Images/Original/gradeGraph.png)

The grade boundaries were:

- 0% - 39% = Fail

- 40% - 49% = 3rd

- 50% - 59% = 2ii

- 60% - 69% = 2i

- +70% = 1st

### At Leeds I:

- Learned about solving non linear equations in MATLAB using Newton's method, Secant method and a few others. 

- Learned about interpolation and animation using normal and inverse kinematics, making a basic BVH file viewer.

- Learned about the storage, processing and creation of 2D and 3D meshes. Creating a basic triangle soup reader.

- Learned about raytracing, making a raytrace renderer in OpenGL.
