# Portfolio-Peter-Holmes
###### A public repository for demonstrating some code and projects I've worked on.

## This Repository
This repository shows off some of the projects I've worked on, each with their own branch. The year prefix refers to the year of university I worked on the project.

## About Me
My name’s Peter Holmes, a current Sheffield Hallam Student hoping to get into the software engineering world.

I've studied a wide range of different subjects gaining experience in DirectX 11 & 12, PlayStation 4 development, Unity and Unreal. Working on many great projects either as part of a team or by myself.

### What I’m Doing
As I said prior, I’m studying at Sheffield Hallam doing computer science for games. This has allowed me to learn a wide array of useful and varied subjects. I’m soon to finish my third year, I'm projected to recieve a strong 2i.

### During the first year I:

- Began learning C++, using SFML to make a side-scrolling survival game.

- Learned useful mathematics to lay the foundations for understanding computer graphics.

- How the different components of the computer work, communicate and process data.

- Took a look at the professional issues surrounding a job in software engineering.

- Began developing a group project as a multi-disciplinary team in a workplace scenario.

### During the second year I:

- Using the knowledge from the first year we took a look at more complex coding practices and began using DirectX 11 as opposed to SFML to make 2D and 3D scenes.

- Took the maths knowledge to the next level to learn how computers handle; lighting, shading, handle polygonal meshes and even physics.

- How to optimise given code with processes like BUD as well as threading and SIMD.

- Developed another project, A game named "Project Simulation", with the same team. Reaching an almost perfect mark of 98 / 100.

### During the third year I:

- I made three videos on a chosen topic in DX12, for the purpose of demonstrating a graphics technique.

- I made a light weight game engine for the PlayStation 4.

- I worked as part of a team to develop a Vulkan port of Zool: Redimentioned in cooperation with Sumo Digital Academy.

- I expanded on my light weight PlayStation 4 engine to add AI agents to a scene.

- For my final year project I developed an Unreal plugin to simulate NBody systems for game developers to use.
